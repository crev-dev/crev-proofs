  It mostly looks to do what it says and seems well written.
  
  There's one concern about possible UB, though one that's unlikely to have any
  practical effect.

  There are probably few places where it could be made little faster or more
  idiomatic. Apart from that, it's a small and simple crate that does what it
  should and the tests seem adequate to the simplicity of the code. No unsafe
  too.
